              The MacBook Pro with M1 is a laptop with an unbeatable combo of
              power and endurance, making it one of the best laptops you can buy
              right now. And I know this because Iâ€™ve been using this system for
              months to plow through my workload, and I can barely get this
              machine to stutter no matter what I throw at it.
